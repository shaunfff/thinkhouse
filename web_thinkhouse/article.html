                  Griffith College is a college where those who want a more
                  flexible approach to learning all round gravitate towards
                  Griffith College leverages industry-firsts in blended and
                  digital-first learning, providing some of the most
                  interesting, unique and future-focused education experiences
                  available in the market. Griffith college genuinely equips
                  their students with the right mix of academic and soft skills
                  which are needed in this new era of education and education;
                  it is in its DNA. From this work, the Thinkhouse planning and
                  creative teams came together to develop a new positioning area
                  for Griffith College, and a new comms platform with which to
                  bring it to life for the consumer: Brand Platform: Griffith
                  College, An Eye On The Future
                </p>
                <h4 class="top-padding-small">The Output</h4>
                <p>
                  The Thinkhouse channel/media planning, creative and specialist
                  service teams worked with Griffith College and their Media
                  partner agency Zenith to develop a deeply engaging,
                  creatively-bold and conversation-driving campaign activation
                  to bring An Eye On The Future to life. The concept featured a
                  modern student with a strangely familiar / not quite right
                  extra eye, one on the lookout for the right future
                  opportunities in this new era of careers and learning. The
                  third eye visual itself alludes to the evolution of
                  human/hybrid via robotics, and speaks to the changing nature
                  of what a modern student for a modern college actually might
                  look like in the future! Creatively, Thinkhouse developed a
                  new brand look/feel for the new comms platform and shot and
                  created multiple audience-specific iterations of creative
                  assets - featuring models, language and messaging to appeal to
                  the CAO audience, the mature student audience and the
                  post-grad/masters audience. The campaign was brought to life
                  for the consumer across DOOH/OOH, Print and PR, with a heavy
                  strand of digital and social DR and engagement-led content to
                  ensure consistent pulsing of applications.

                <h4 class="top-padding-small">The outcome</h4>
                <p>
                  The campaign was launched in September 2019, so it is
                  currently at early stages. However, the response from students
                  and (the diverse) faculty alike in the college has been
                  phenomenal. Head of Marketing at Griffith College, Steven
                  Roberts, said: “The College was impressed with Thinkhouse’s
                  knowledge of younger audiences, which are a perfect fit with
                  Griffith’s learners. Their team’s ambition, creativity and
                  track record of developing outstanding campaigns was key to
                  the decision to bring them on board. At Griffith, we’re as
                  ambitious as our students are. For this campaign, we wanted an
                  idea that represented us perfectly – future-focused,
                  innovation-centric and welcoming. This campaign perfectly does
                  that.”
